# Hatched Area Calculation and Camera Coverage Visualization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on calculating of hatched areas and visualizing camera coverage on a given floor plan using image processing techniques. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Hatched Area Calculation**: Identifies and calculates the area of hatched regions within an architectural layout using traditional image processing techniques like masking, thresholding, and morphological operations.
   
2. **Camera Coverage Visualization**: Determines and visualizes the coverage areas of security cameras based on their specifications and positions. It uses edge detection to account for obstacles and renders the effective coverage areas of each camera.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this project, you need the following software and libraries:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `matplotlib`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mohammedabdalqader/hatched-area-calculation-camera-coverage-visualization.git
    cd hatshed-area-calculation-camera-coverage-visualization
    ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
